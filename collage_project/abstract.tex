The rapid digitalization of services has amplified the need for secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication mechanisms that transcend the limitations of conventional password or single-factor approaches. 

This project proposes a \textbf{Blockchain-Enabled Multi-Biometric and Multi-ID Authentication System} that leverages the combined power of distributed ledger technology and AI/ML-driven decision models to deliver a robust, tamper-resistant identity verification framework. By integrating multiple biometric modalities—such as \emph{fingerprint, iris, face, and voice recognition}—with government-issued and organizational identity proofs, the system ensures multi-layered trust while reducing the risks associated with spoofing, identity theft, and credential compromise. 

\medskip

\noindent
\textbf{Blockchain} is employed to provide immutable, transparent, and decentralized storage of authentication records, eliminating reliance on a single point of failure. Meanwhile, \textbf{AI/ML algorithms} enhance accuracy through adaptive learning, anomaly detection, and contextual risk scoring. 

The proposed architecture is designed with interoperability, scalability, and privacy-preservation at its core, enabling seamless deployment across domains such as \emph{e-governance, financial services, healthcare, and IoT ecosystems}. This framework not only strengthens cybersecurity resilience but also charts a pathway toward a unified, trustless, and user-centric digital identity infrastructure.
